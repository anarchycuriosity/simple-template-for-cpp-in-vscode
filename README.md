Just first attampt to push repo as a beginner.

As many students around me feel "overwhelmed" facing the complex settings of vscode, which I think can be actually simple.
That's why I made this repo. What they need is nothing but simple functions at the beginning, which leads them to know the charm of vsc.
Inspired by my friend's template, I think the function of automatically placing binary files is simple but cool.
